// Bitwise operator is an operator that works on binary representation of an input number 

// Bitwise And &: If both the bits are 1 then then output will be 1
// Bitwise Or | : If any of the bits is 1 then the output will be 1
// Bitwise Xor ^ : If both the bits are different then the output will be 1 
// Left shifting x by y is X * 2^y
// Right shifting x by y is X/2^y

// It is unary operator
// Bitwise NOT (~) : It inverse all the bits in binary representation
